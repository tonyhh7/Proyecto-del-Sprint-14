# ðŸ“Š Final Data Analysis Project (Sprint 14)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project serves as the **final capstone** of the data analysis program. The goal is to integrate **all learned techniques**, including **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and business insights**, to solve a real-world problem.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- The best-performing model was **XGBoost**, achieving an accuracy of **X%**.  
- Feature importance analysis showed that **[key variable]** had the highest impact on predictions.  
- **Business insight:** Implementing targeted interventions for high-risk groups could increase revenue by **Y%**.
